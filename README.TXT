PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Using java, explore theroies learned in Operating Systems
VERSION or DATE: 1.0.1
ABOUT:
Server:
    Classes:
                Server:         This is the parent thread. Its main purpose is to find connections for new clients. It also will starts the server controls and Holds information about its self.

                ClientInput:    This is a child thread. It will wait for output from a server and print it off.
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
    Download the server files on a host machine running java.
    Download the client files on a client machine running java. 
    Start the server files
    Locate IP address of the server, on the clients side run the program, and connect to the server IP address

EXPLAIN:
The server starts, clients connect to it. Clients can send messages to server, and server can send messages to clients

WHATS NEXT:
I completed my inital goal for this project. The next phase may be to make it a desktop application.
